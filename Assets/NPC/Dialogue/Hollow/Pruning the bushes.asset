    - Hi
    - I am Amaranth
    - The gardener
    - I am trimming the tree
    - And these bushes
    - And this grass
    - Oh my gosh
    - The grass
    - The young hooligans try to eat it
    - Especially that child Geestrul
    - He is a menace to society
    - '"I wanna eat the grass"'
    - '"*munch munch* I''m not *munch munch* eating grass"'
    - '"why would you think that?"'
    - If you see that demon
    - Kick him in the shins for me
    - And give him some firm words from a gardener who is far to old for any of this
  - text:
    - Give a firm word to Geestrul if you see him
    - I need to retire soon
    - This is all far to much
