    - Hello.
    - I am Arcadia
    - I come here a lot to relax
    - Looking out on the unending void
    - The sounds of nature all around
    - The teleportation magic on the doorway here is really something isn't it?
    - It is fantastic to get away from everything
    - I make books you know
    - They are really good books
    - I just need to make so many
    - And it never stops
    - So I come here a lot to look out on the universe
    - It is strangely beautiful to look out and see how small you are
    - And yet that doesn't make this little insignificant garden any less beautiful
    - It also helps me with my worries
    - If I am this small compared to everything
    - Then my worries can't be that big
    - That's why I think this place is so special
    - I don't know why I told you all this
    - Well thanks for listening
    - Sometimes it's nice to have someone who is good at listening
    - Hopefully you can find the same peace from this place that I can
    - Anyway I think we should just enjoy this in silence.

    - I think enjoying this beautiful place in silence is the best for both of us
