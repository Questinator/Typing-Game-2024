  incantation: Since classical times, it has been known that some materials, such
    as amber, attract lightweight particles after rubbing. The Greek word for amber,
    electron, was thus the source of the word 'electricity'. Electrostatic phenomena
    arise from the forces that electric charges exert on each other. Such forces
    are described by Coulomb's law.
